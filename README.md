Git clone like you normally do to the `custom_nodes` folder.   
There are no requirements.  

Or install via the comfyui manager using url    `https://github.com/CoreyCorza/ComfyUI-CRZnodes.git`

To change the min/max range of the sliders, double click on the slider handle.  
The description tells you what each value represents.  
Here the min is 1, the max is set to 10, and the slider handle will step in increments of 1.

Same with the float slider.  
Min, max, step increments, and how many decimal places.

# Dropdowns
Dropdowns automatically inherit the list from whatever they were connected to.   
There may be cases where they don't - Let me know.

# Preferences
A `CRZ` button should be shown in the bottom left corner of the viewport.  
You can also summon the preferences with ctrl+shift+c.  
Not sure about this keyboard shortcut as some people might use that for other things. If its a problem let me know, might be able to work something else out.
